# Source maps uploader

This is a tiny build pack to run after the javascript assets are compiled, and source maps are generated to [upload it to Rollbar](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/source-maps#3-upload-your-source-map-files) and upload it to Sentry, so we can have the source maps available before the first error occurrence.

## Usage

Add the build pack to your application:

```bash
heroku buildpacks:add volders/source-maps-uploader
```

After that, you need [activate the dyno metadata](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) for your app. During the build [we have](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api#bin-compile-summary) the `SOURCE_VERSION` env variable. However, we need the `HEROKU_SLUG_COMMIT` when the application is running to [set the `code_version` option](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/source-maps#2-configure-the-rollbarjs-sdk-to-support-source-maps).

Next, add a `ROLLBAR_POST_SERVER_TOKEN` environment variable to your app with your `post_server_item` Rollbar token found in your project access tokens settings page found here: Settings â†’ Project Access Tokens (`https://rollbar.com/volders/<the-project-name>/settings/access_tokens`.

The same way, add a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to your app with your Sentry token found in the [Auth Tokens settings page](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/), which must have the `project:read`, `project:releases`, and `org:read` scopes. Other than that, you also need to add the `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` environment variables with the slugs for the organization and project on Sentry, which you can get from the project URL, like https://sentry.io/organizations/{SENTRY_ORG}/projects/{SENTRY_PROJECT}.

Also, add an `APP_DOMAIN` environment variable with the application domain.

Then, add a `.source-maps-uploader` file in the root of your repository with the path to where the source maps are. For example:

```
app/assets/builds
```

In the next deployment, you should see the uploaded files in the build log:

```
...
-----> Uploading source to Rollbar maps...
       Uploading file public/packs/js/application-ef490583af6aebb9bf03.js.map
       Uploading file public/packs/js/other-bc62c70ba43856d88229.js.map
       Source maps uploading to Rollbar  completed
...
```

And on the Rollbar source maps page from the project: `https://rollbar.com/volders/<the-project-name>/settings/source_map`.

**Note**: This build pack does not work out of the box for the review apps because we can't activate the dyno metadata using the `app.json`. To use it in a review app, you must manually activate the dyno metadata and set the `APP_DOMAIN` to the correct review app address.
